# 📱 Student Management System (Android + Spring Boot)

This project was created **for educational purposes** — to help students learn how a **mobile application** can communicate with a **Spring Boot backend** using **REST APIs**.

---

## 🎯 Overview

The **Student Management System** is a simple **Android CRUD app** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) built to demonstrate how to integrate a mobile frontend with a Java-based backend.

- **Frontend:** Android (Java)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **API Client:** Retrofit2
- **ORM:** Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)

The app allows users to:
- ➕ Create new student records  
- 📖 View all students  
- ✏️ Update student details  
- ❌ Delete student records  

All operations are performed through **HTTP requests** handled by the backend REST API.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

### 💻 Android App
- **Language:** Java  
- **HTTP Client:** Retrofit2  
- **Architecture:** Simple Activity-based navigation  
- **IDE:** Android Studio  

### 🧠 Backend
- **Framework:** Spring Boot  
- **Persistence:** Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The Android app uses **Retrofit2** to send HTTP requests to the Spring Boot backend.  
2. The backend exposes REST endpoints for student management.  
3. Data is persisted in a **PostgreSQL** database using **JPA** and **Hibernate**.  
4. Responses are returned in JSON format and displayed in the mobile app.

## 🧪 Educational Purpose

This project is developed to:
- Demonstrate end-to-end integration between **Android** and **Spring Boot**
- Help students understand **HTTP communication**, **Retrofit**, and **CRUD operations**
- Serve as a base for learning **mobile + backend API design**

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🖥️ Backend
1. Clone the backend Spring Boot repository.
2. Configure your `application.properties` with your PostgreSQL credentials.
3. Run the project using:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
